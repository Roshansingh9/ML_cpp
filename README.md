# ML_cpp

This repository contains implementations of machine learning algorithms written in C++.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Linear Regression**: A simple implementation of linear regression using the Ordinary Least Squares method to fit a line to data points.
- **Bayes' Theorem**: Calculation of posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem for probabilistic inference.

## Features
- Clean and readable C++ code  
- Easy to understand and extend for learning purposes  
- Examples included for testing each algorithm  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., `g++`)

### Compilation
To compile any program, use:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output_name
